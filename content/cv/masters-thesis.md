**Master's Thesis - NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center**

I spent five months in Washington DC working on a project called [OpenSpace](https://www.openspaceproject.com/) which is a collaboration between Link√∂ping University, American Museum of Natural History and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. This project aims to visualize the what we know about the universe using real data provided by NASA.
