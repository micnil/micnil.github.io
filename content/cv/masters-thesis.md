**Master's Thesis - NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center**

I spent five months in Washington DC working on a project called [OpenSpace](https://www.openspaceproject.com/) which is a collaboration between NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Link√∂ping University, and American Museum of Natural History. This project aims to visualize the what we know about the universe using real data provided by NASA.
