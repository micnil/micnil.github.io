Freakolution is a 2D/3D hybrid multiplayer game made by me and three team members in Unity3D for a Game Design course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in singapore
<!-- end -->
The game is a wave-survival game with a top-down perspective. Freakolution won first prize in the MAGIC game challenge competition at NTU for outstanding performance. It can be played by four people on the same screen (not split screen) and was intended for a console platform. The game was written in C# and it gave me good base knowledge for the language.
