Freakolution is a 2D/3D hybrid multiplayer game made by me and three team members in Unity3D for a Game Design course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in singapore
<!-- end -->
The game is a wave-survival game with a top-down perspective. Freakolution won first prize in the [MAGIC](https://magic.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/default.aspx) game challenge competition at NTU for outstanding performance. It can be played by four people on the same screen (not split screen) and was intended for a console platform. The game is written in **Unity** with **C#**.
