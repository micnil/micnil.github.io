Just a simple 2D particle system, marking my initial interest in JavaScript.

You can drag and rotate the force fields and particle emitters around the canvas. You can create new components and pause the simulation. I think the results were quite mesmarizing to look at. A fun game could be how long you can avoid getting hit by particles with the "puller".

Project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/micnil/JS-Particle-System) and this [demopage](http://micnil.github.io/JS-Particle-System/).
