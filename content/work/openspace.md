**Master's Thesis - NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center**

I spent five months in Washington DC working on a project called OpenSpace which is a collaboration between Linköping University, American Museum of Natural History and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. This project aims to visualize the what we know about the universe using real data provided by NASA.
