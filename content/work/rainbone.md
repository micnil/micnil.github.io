A voice controlled puzzle game for large audience in dome environments.
<!-- end -->
For a course in Media Production for Immersive Environments I and four team members had the opportunity to create an immersive experience for the dome in [Visualization Center C](http://visualiseringscenter.se/en/about-c). We chose to create a game that would include the whole audience of all ages. It is a puzzle game where the objective is to open a path for a cat through layers of shuffled circles by aligning the openings. This is done by screeming at a microphone placed in front of the audience. The higher the audience screems, the more torque is put on the circles.

The project is written in **C++** and **OpenGL**, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ellenhager/Rainbone).
