Sectra works to increase the effectiveness of healthcare, while maintaining or increasing the quality of care. We do it by building future-proof, effective medical imaging IT solutions. In my department we are building a diagnostic workstation for radiologist, and our team is primarily focused on end-user workflow and reporting. We help the radiologist produce their reports more effectively, build tools for workflow management and lesion tracking, and integrate with other systems.

Sectra is very customer focused, and we provide technical product support and regularly visit customers all over the world.
