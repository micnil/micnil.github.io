I am regularly active on StackOverflow, a poplular Q&A site for professional and enthusiast programmers. From here my 50+ answers and 20+ question has reached over 100 000 people. Most of my answers are related to JavaScript or THREE.js (a JavaScript WebGL library).

Recent years i've found myself enjoying answering questions on Stack Overflow. A question is usually complex enough for me to research it and learning something new, and simple enough to fit into one evening, appeasing my programming urge. It is a nice way to give back to the community, for all that it has given me, and rewarding to know that your helping others that are facing problems.

You'll find my profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346060/micnil), and linked below are some of the questions and answers I like the most:
