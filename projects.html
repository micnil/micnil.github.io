        <p>
          When discussing any kind of topic among your friends and you disagree in some matter, it could be interesting to find out what the general public thinks about it. Maybe it is about something important like the election, filosofical like life after death, useful like book review opinions or something completely absurd like what color the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_(viral_phenomenon)" target="_blank">dress</a> is. What if...? Would you rather...? What is most important...?
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to provide a platform where people not only can get direct result after anonymously voting on a poll, but can also filter the results to see statistics on certain properties of the voters like nationality, age and sex. People should be able to search for polls, follow them, add poll tags for filtering and discuss in the comments.</br>
          The application is still in very early development.

          The app is made for polling, and that's just what it does.

        <p> For a course in Media Production for Immersive Environments I and four team members had the opportunity to create an immersive experience for the dome in <a href="http://visualiseringscenter.se/en/about-c" target="_blank">Visualization Center C</a>. We chose to create a game that would include the whole audience of all ages. It is a puzzle game where the objective is to open a path for a cat through layers of shuffled circles by aligning the openings. This is done by screeming at a microphone placed in front of the audience. The higher the audience screems, the more torque is put on the circles.</p>

        <p> For a course in Procedural methods for Images I created a WebGl city generator. The generator starts out with a rectangular plane and splits it recursively with two rules for size and form. This leaves us with a road network, and inside each block a building is extruded with a Simplex noise function. The textures on the buildings and roads are also generated procedurally.</p>

      <h4>Box Sorting Robotics</h4>
      <p>This is a project i have been working on for a course called 2D & 3D Animation at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. It is a robot arm simulation that tries to sort boxes based on color while the user disrupts with the mouse pointer.</p>
      <div class="more hidden">
        <p>The robot arm movement is simulated using inverse kinematics. Each delta movement is found with an pseudo inverse jacobian algorithm with damping. The arm has been made stiff and the target position for each segment is manipulated to avoid "uncomfortable" positions. The algorithm was first tested in a pure javascript 2D version which can be found <a href="/inverse_kinematics_2D">here</a>, and was later ported to this improved 3D version using webGL through the Three.js framework. Apart from that, Cannon.js is used for the box physics and Sylvester.js is used for matrix operations.</p>

        <p> The game is a wave-survival game with a top-down perspective. Freakolution won first prize in the MAGIC game challenge competition at NTU for outstanding performance. It can be played by four people on the same screen (not split screen) and was intended for a console platform. The game was written in C# and it gave me good base knowledge for the language.</p>

      <h4>MMDG</h4>
      <p> Massive Multiplayer Dome Game (MMDG) is a system that allows a developer to connect
      their program to a server (MMDG-server), so that players can connect and control it through 
      their phone.</p>
      <div class="more hidden">
        <p> 
        The system was created by me and six other team members for our under-graduate examination project. Our customer was <a href="http://visualiseringscenter.se/" target="_blank">Visualization Center C</a> in Norrköping Sweden, which hosts a large-scale arena for public visits and events including media labs, interactive exhibitions and an immersive 3D fulldome theatre. Our assignment was to make it possible for an audience at the dome theatre to connect to an application through their phone's web-browser, displaying a customizable interface, so that they can interact with the show. It was also intended to be used as a pre-show entertainment for the audience to be able to play a small and simple multiplayer game in the dome while waiting for the show to start. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A developer can customize the GUI that displays on the users phone with a XML configuration file. When users connect to the server the GUI is rendered and a websocket connection is established. Then a TCP connection needs to be established between the developers application and the MMDG-server. If it is used in the dome-theatre, a MMDG-core class written in C++ can be used for this connection. When the user interacts with the developer-defined buttons, messages are sent to the application.    
        </p> 

        <p> the proof-of-concept-game we created was called RobberCop. It allowed around one hundred concurrent clients to play the game at once on the same screen</p>

        <p class="small_text"> attempt to show system design, and communication between modules. </p>
        <p>This project really introduced us to many aspects of software development. Working with a real customer with a big team (eight people) and following a development methodology (Scrum). We had to learn about internet protocols, server programming and writing programs for the dome-theatre. Java was used for the server, Javascript and HTML/CSS for the GUI, and OpenGL with a framework called SGCT for the game.</p>

      <h4>B-spline Editor</h4>
      <p> A simple B-spline editor made by me for a 3D Modelling course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in singapore</p>
        <div class="more hidden">
          <p> The editor is not very advanced or intuitive unfortunatly. The assignment was to be able to render a B-spline with a uniform algorithm and a Adaptive algorithm from a text file that specifies: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The degree of B-spline</li>
            <li>The number of Control Points</li>
            <li>Knot sequence in 1 row</li>
            <li>Control points, 1 point per row</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When this was done, I decided to further develop the the program with another algorithm called DeBoor algorithm and improve the user interface a bit. Now you can create B-splines directly in the Canvas and move the control points around. There is still no way to specify the knot sequence from the interface, so it only renders uniform B-splines</p>

          <p>The game was made by me and four team members and was developed with webGL to make it more available. No webGL framework was used which gave us an in-depth understanding of webGL and javascript. The rotation, curve of curl path, and collisions was the focus of the simulation.
