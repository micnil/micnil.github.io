      <h4>Freakolution</h4>
      <p>Freakolution is a 2D/3D hybrid multiplayer game made by me and three team members in Unity3D for a Game Design course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in singapore</p>

        <p> The game is a wave-survival game with a top-down perspective. The game won first prize in the MAGIC game challenge competition at NTU for outstanding performance. It can be played by four people on the same screen (not split screen) and was intended for a console platform. The game was written in C# and it gave me good base knowledge for the language</p>

      <h4>MMDG</h4>
      <p> Massive Multiplayer Dome Game (MMDG) is a system that allows a developer to connect
      his/her game to a server (MMDG-server), so that players can connect and control the game through 
      their phone.</p>
      <div class="more">
        <p> The system was created by me and six other team members for our under graduate examination project. Its intended use
        was for an audience at a dome theater at the Visualization Centre in Norrköping, Sweden, to connect to a small and simple game
        through their phone while waiting for the dome-show.</p> 

        <p> the proof-of-concept-game we created allowed around one hundred concurrent clients to play at once on the same screen</p>

      <h4>B-spline Editor</h4>
      <p> A simple B-spline editor made by me for a 3D Modelling course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in singapore</p>
        <div class="more">
          <p> The editor is not very advanced or intuitive unfortunatly. It can render B-splines with two different algorithms. The Deboor algorithm and a uniform algorithm. The uniform algorithm first transforms the B-splines into Bezier curves and renders them individually with different amount of samples. The control points can only be manipulated if you specify the B-spline data in a text file and upload it to the editor. This was done because our examinator requested it. If you dont use text files, you only get uniform B-splines. </p>

      <h4>Space Curling</h4>
      <p> This is a Curling game/simulation made in a Modelling and Simulation course at Linköpings University in Sweden. The Assignment was to make a realistic physics simulation. </p>
      <div class="more">
          <p>The game was made by me and four team members and was developed with webGL to make it more available. No webGL framework was used which gave us an in-depth understanding of webGL and javascript. The rotation, curve of curl path, and collisions was the focus of the simulation. The game part is just a bonus</p>

      <h4>JS Particles</h4>
      <p>Just a simple particle system in javascript made by me a couple of nights after working hours last summer</p>
      <div class="more">
          <p>You can drag and rotate the force fields and particle emitters around. You can create new components and pause the simulation. At the moment there is no limit of particles, which can make it laggy (might even crash) if you gather to many on screen </p>
